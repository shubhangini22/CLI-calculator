Day thirty-nine
The thing that death gave you â€”
your face leaks
your face overflows

Your face is the grave of your nose
your face is the grave of your ears
your face is the grave of your face
once again your face overflows uncontrollably

The subzero temperature grows on your face then dies
(You were underground from the moment you were born)
The air that sticks to your eyes is as cold as the knife blade
the wind that sticks to your heart is as hot as the palm of a hand
You want to shout that you miss me
but there is another ground beneath the ground
